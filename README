What is simplesite
------------------
Simplesite is a static site generator. Basically it converts restructuredtext files to a simple website, adding appropriate html and a menu linking the site toghether.

It is entirely contained in a single Bash script and requires only rst2html from Python Docutils to be installed.

Intended as an easy and succinct tool with only the bare minimum of functionality. Please note the following.

* Must be run from the *ss_root* (directory containing simplesite.conf)
* Pages are restructuredtext files located in *ss_root/source*
* To include CSS, Javascritp, images etc, add them to the *ss_root/include* directory and add appropriate links/references in the *ss_root/template* files
* Run **simplesite** from *ss_root* to generate site


Usage
-----
1. Initialize by running **simplesite --init** in an empty directory
2. Most probably edit the *ss_root/template* files
3. Add appropriate elements to *ss_root/include* (e.g. CSS) 
4. Add content by creating restructuredtext files in the *ss_root/source* directory, please see note regarding naming below
5. Build site by running **simplesite** (must be in *ss_root* directory), upload the *ss_root/site* dir to a web server

.. note:: File naming convention
	The name of the source file will become the url and also the title of each html page.

	Given a source file called **ss_root/source/simplesite-faq.txt** the following will happen.

	* URL will be */simple-site.html*
	* Title tag will become *Simplesite faq*

Site generation
---------------
On generation the following happend.

* All source files are converted to html and saved to *ss_root/site*
* The all files in *ss_root/include* directory are copied to *ss_root/site*

When run simplesite will check for existance of *ss_root/deployment*, if this file is executable it will be run after the site generation has completed. This script will subsequently be run and can for example upload the *ss_root/site* to a FTP server.

Limitations
-----------
The name should give an indication that this is a basic site generator as such the following limitations apply.

* All pages share same layout
* No site hiearachy, all pages will be on the web root level
* Only head tag customization per page available is setting the title tag
